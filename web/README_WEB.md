## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Simple Python Server (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to web directory**
   ```bash
   cd web/
   ```

2. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `https://localhost:8000`
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning (safe for local use)

### Method 2: Any Web Server

You can serve the web app with any HTTP server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (with serve package)
npx serve

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000

# Apache/Nginx
# Point document root to the web/ directory
```

**Important**: For microphone access, most browsers require HTTPS. The included server script automatically handles this.
